TransactionalGolo
=================

Basic local transactions (via Narayana core) into Golo.

Initially JTA or AtomicAction, with the assumption of some datasource written elsewhere in Java or Golo that can be enrolled by the application in the transaction. Final goal is to have STM in Golo.

Paused for now.
